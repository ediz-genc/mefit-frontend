### Team Contract

#### Committing, Branching, and Pull Requests

1. Purpose

- This agreement aims to establish a clear and efficient workflow for software development, specifically focusing on committing code, creating branches, and handling pull requests. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to enhance collaboration, code quality, and project progress.

2. Version Control System

- We will use [Version Control System (e.g., Git)] as the foundation for managing our codebase.

3. Committing Code

- Commits should be meaningful and focused, addressing specific tasks or issues.
- Commit messages must be concise and descriptive, summarizing the purpose of the changes.
- Use present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Commits should be accompanied by well-structured and documented code.

4. Branching Strategy

- We will use a [branching strategy, e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow] to manage our branches.
- Master/Main: This branch represents production-ready code and must always be in a deployable state.
- Development: Feature branches are merged into this branch for integration testing.
- Feature/Branches: Each feature or task should have its own dedicated branch.
- Bugfix/Branches: Separate branches are created for bug fixes.

5. Creating Branches

- Branch names should be descriptive and reflect the task or feature they represent.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., "feature/feature-name," "bugfix/issue-number").

6. Pull Requests (PRs)

- Before creating a PR, ensure that the code is tested and adheres to coding standards.
- PRs should address specific issues or features, and their titles should be descriptive.
- Include a clear description of the changes made in the PR description.
- Assign the PR to appropriate reviewers.
- PRs require a minimum number of approvals (define the number) before merging.
- Avoid force-pushing to a PR branch after opening the PR.

7. Reviewing PRs

- Reviewers should provide constructive feedback on code, style, and functionality.
- Reviews should be completed within a defined timeframe (e.g., 2 business days).
- Address feedback and discuss any discrepancies in the PR discussion.
- Once approved, the author of the PR is responsible for merging it.

8. Merging PRs

- PRs can only be merged if they have received the required approvals and passed tests.
- Use the "Squash and Merge" strategy to maintain a clean and meaningful commit history.

9. Code Quality and Testing

- All code should undergo testing (unit, integration, etc.) before being merged.
- Automated testing should be integrated into our workflow to maintain code quality.
- Avoid merging code that breaks the build or causes tests to fail.

10. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and refine our development workflow for improvements.
- Encourage open discussions about bottlenecks or challenges in the process.

11. Communication

- Keep team members informed about significant changes, challenges, or updates to the workflow.
- If there's uncertainty, don't hesitate to seek clarification or assistance from colleagues.

12. Adherence

- By following this agreement, we commit to enhancing collaboration, code quality, and project progress.

13. Signatures
